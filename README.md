# planet-reborn
Our group project for CS 583, made with Unity

Branching away from the main to test some features.
I highly recommend that any changes made here should NOT be pushed into the main branch.

TO-DO LIST
- [ ] Set up basic player movement.
- [ ] Set up the third person player camera.
- [X] Set up a local version of the project that's pushable to a secondary branch.
